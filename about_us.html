              The impact of consulting firms on local businesses in emerging
              economies do not always have positive effects.[16] One reason for
              this is that firms in emerging economies suffer from the
              inferiority of their technologies and innovation capabilities,
              thus, although they have access to consulting firms, they cannot
              make the most of the advice given. Advice given by consulting
              firms to clients may not be used efficiently as clients firms in
              emerging markets tend to suffer due to a lack of infrastructure,
              organisation, and education. Another reason firms in emerging
              economies struggle to effectively use consulting services is that
              innovation is very costly and risky.
